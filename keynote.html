                                <b>Abstract: </b>Sequence and graph prediction problems can generally be handled with 'unstructured' sequence-to-sequence models, often leading to strong performance, especially in i.i.d. settings. In this talk, instead, I will discuss alternatives that approach the transduction process in a  'structured' way, aiming for improved interpretability and out-of-distribution generalization. In the first part, I will discuss how a text-to-graph generation problem can be tackled by inducing graph decomposition and alignments as part of learning. This method yields a neural graph generator that, at inference time, simply tags the input sequence with graph fragments. We will see how this idea is used to produce an accurate (AMR) and transparent semantic parser.  In the second part, I will discuss how seq-to-seq problems can be handled by a neural model which models the 'translation' process as structured permutation and monotonic translation of the subsequences.  We will see that this structured method leads to improvements in out-of-distribution ("compositional") generalization on semantic parsing and machine translation tasks.

                                <b>Abstract: </b>Transformers have made progress in miscellaneous tasks, but suffer from quadratic computational and memory complexities. Recent works propose sparse Transformers with attention on sparse graphs to reduce complexity and remain strong performance. While effective, the crucial parts of how dense a graph needs to be to perform well are not fully explored. In this talk, we introduce Normalized Information Payload (NIP), a graph scoring function measuring information transfer on graph, which provides an analysis tool for trade-offs between performance and complexity. Guided by this theoretical analysis, we present Hypercube Transformer, a sparse Transformer that models token interactions in a hypercube and shows comparable or even better results with vanilla Transformer while yielding O(NlogN) complexity with sequence length N.

                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <b>Abstract: </b> Many advances in deep learning exploit the intrinsic structure of the data. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks leverage the fact that images are a regular grid of pixels, whereas recurrent neural networks exploit the temporal structure of text-based data. Inspired by this success, the new field of geometric deep learning aims to develop deep learning architectures for datasets such as graphs and manifolds with less regular structure. 
								<br />
								A principal challenge in this endeavor is defining a proper notion of convolutional filters. Many graph neural networks propose to define graph convolution as a localized averaging operation. While these networks achieve great success on benchmark datasets, they are known to suffer from the oversmoothing problem, i.e., they do not preserve high-frequency information. This motivates us to define an alternative, wavelet-based model of graph neural networks known as the graph scattering transform. In its initial form, the graph scattering transform is a handcrafted network with no learnable parameters (except in the final layer). This version of the graph scattering transform has the advantage of (i) being amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis and (ii) not requiring much training data. However, handcraftedness is also a form of rigidity that limits the ability of the network to learn. Therefore, I will also introduce several new variations of the graph scattering transform which are able to learn from data.

                                <b>Abstract: </b>Graph based approaches have been increasingly utilized for different NLP applications, however, what types of structures should be leveraged and to what extent these graph structures help still remain challenging. In this talk, we take a closer look at graph neural networks via two typical NLP applications: structure-aware conversation summarization and knowledge-graph enhanced question answering. Concretely, the first section looks at how to utilize graph structures to better encode discourse relations and actions in conversations for improved dialogue summarization, and the second part  dissects state-of-the-art graph neural network modules and their reasoning capability for question answering.
